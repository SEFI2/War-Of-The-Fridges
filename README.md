# War-Of-The-Fridges

The game is fully developed and can be played by our
target users who is elderly. 

The Background of the Game:
  You are left alone in this world with many crazy fridges
which want to control whole Earth and freeze anything
in this world.. As the technology was improving, fridges
became smarter and smarter. One day, all refrigerators
from whole world announced the war to the human
race. It was so unexpected, so that people couldn’t
prevent this tragedy. The fridges, in few weeks, started
to control our homeland. But we have the last chance:
the green tree. You should kill as many fridges as
possible and shouldn’t let the fridges to freeze the last
tree of the Earth.

Survival KIT. 
  You will be given two weapons which is
knife and gun, You can use these two equipment to
survive and at the same time save yourself. As our logic
accepts, there is no life if we don’t have an Earth, so if
fridges conquer your grass and tree completely, you
status will be recorded as looser and you will get the
score you collected but the game will be terminated.

Game Instruction Details: Knife is one of the
weapons, with which you can kill fridges when they
are close to you. Auto Gun, weapon, which starts to shoot when
you make gun gesture with middle and index
fingers. To change weapons player should make “Rock”
gesture.

Phong shading with four lights were used as
the primary shading.
Fridge, six different textures were used for
fridge creation; they are coming straight to the
tree and freeze the nature, grass and tree.The player placed in the green environment- nature.

The Fridge Robots have an ability to freeze the grass. The Fridges move forward and it decrease the radius. There are two types of Robots –one anti-environment,
other one is environment friendly. The equation will be given to the elderly to calculate.
The Result of the calculation help elderly to distinguish
the type of the robots. The user will lose if the tree and grass get completely
frozen.

Indicators of grass’s radius and number of robots are
located at the up left corner of the monitor. Equations which
determine which robot is good or bad are also located at the
up left corner of the monitor (three of them.


Elderly people are the most growing part of the population in developed countries (Europe, North America, Japan and
Korea). Our team is concerned about this issue and wants to bring some changes about elderly people stereotypes. If we consider
that young generation is busy all day along and deep into the technologies, the elderly population is getting more and more isolated
and having lack of the attention and interaction. This isolation can lead to a lack in physical and cognitive activities. Based on the
background research we found that mental exercise plays one of the greatest role to stay active and alive. It prevents seniors to get
dementia or other disease such as Alzheimer. Mental exercise stimulates the brain, often providing long lasting positive effects
regarding thinking, reasoning skills, memory and processing speed. Board games and puzzles are the most used methods to keep
elderly mentally active.
